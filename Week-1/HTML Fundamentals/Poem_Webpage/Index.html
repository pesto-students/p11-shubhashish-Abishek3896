      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />
      Are you-Nobody-too? <br />
      Then there's a pair of us! <br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know! <br />
      <br />
      How Dreary - to be - somebody! <br />
      How public - like a frog - <br />
      To tell one's name - the livelong June- <br />
      To an admiring Bog! <br />
