What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?
The Protocol stack forms the basis of client server architecture, on how the client communicates with the webserver and the different layers in the protocol stack performs specific tasks to help with networking, performance, and security. The protocol stack is divided into four layers.
(I) physical layer (ethernet).
(II) Networking layer (IPv4 or IPv6).
(III) Transport layer (TCP/ UDP).
(IV) Application layer (http, TLS, DNS).
What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?
There are five different types of web servers.
(i) Apache: It is an open-source web server maintained by Apache; it is highly customizable with a wide range of modules available to extend its functionality. Apache is highly configurable and can be fine-tuned to meet the specific needs of a website or web application.
(ii) Nginx: Nginx is another popular open-source web server that is known for its high performance and low resource usage. One of the key features of Nginx is to handle concurrent users efficiently, which makes it highly suited for handling high traffic volumes.
(iii) Microsoft IIS: It is a proprietary web server developed by Microsoft for use with the Windows operating system. Since its not open-source configurability becomes an issue and restricted to windows environment. However, it also offers a wide range of modules and is reliable and performance oriented for windows environment.
(iv) Lighttpd: Lighttpd is a free and open-source web server designed to be lightweight, fast, and efficient. It has low memory footprint and performance is limited. One of the key features of Lighttpd is its modular design, which allows users to easily customize and extend the server's functionality.
(v) Jigsaw: Jigsaw is a web server that was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a reference implementation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol. Jigsaw remains a popular choice for developers who are interested in learning about web server technology and HTTP protocols but may not be suitable for production because of lack of development and support.
What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?
Web Hosting is a technique used for hosting web applications by providing web servers. There are five different types of hosting services available for websites.
(i) Shared resource: One server hosting multiple applications. Not recommended for high traffic applications.
(ii) Cloud Hosting: It is an Iaas concept where the underlying servers will be maintained by the service providers and the amount of resource allocated for your website will be based on the service plans which you pay for. Security is a concern here since the maintenance is being done by someone.
(iii) Managed Hosting/ VPN Hosting/ Dedicated Hosting: They all are in house hosting concepts where you maintain and manage the servers. Security wonâ€™t be a concern since you manage the servers. However, availability and scalability might become a major factor.
What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?
Scaling is the concept of increasing the resources of the underlying server for increasing productivity. Scaling prevents the servers from faltering due to increased traffic of web applications. Scaling is done on two fronts. (i) Vertical Scaling, where the resources are increased with a single server to cater to the requirement. (ii) Horizontal Scaling, where multiple servers are added on top of the existing server to cater to the requirement.
What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?
SEO is used by developers to rank their websites at the highest by the respective search engines. The Search engines rank the websites based on the following requirements upon which optimization can be performed.
(i) If the aesthetics of the website is better and the loading time less.
(ii) If the right key words are present in the website for the search engine to pick up as a filter.
(iii) If the relevant backlinks are present to switch between different pages in the application.
(iv) Having a social media presence for the website/Application.
